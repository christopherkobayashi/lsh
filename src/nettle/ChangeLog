2002-02-19  Niels Möller  <nisse@cuckoo.hack.org>

	* configure.in (asm_path): Renamed "path" to "asm_path". Also look
	for a machine.m4.

2002-02-16  Niels Möller  <nisse@cuckoo.hack.org>

	* sparc/aes.asm: Use that IDX2(j) == j ^ 2

	* Makefile.am (libnettle_a_SOURCES): Reordered aes-decrypt.c and
	aes-encrypt.c. For some strange reason it makes the benchmark go
	faster... 

	* sparc/aes.asm (_aes_crypt): Use double-buffering, and no
	separate loop for adding the round key.
	(round): Keep round index muliplied by 16, so it can be used
	directly for indexing the subkeys.
	(_aes_crypt): In the final loop, use ctx+round to access the
	subkeys, no need for an extra register.

2002-02-15  Niels Möller  <nisse@cuckoo.hack.org>

	* sparc/aes.asm (_aes_crypt): Renaming variables, allocating
	locals starting from %l0.

	innermost loops.
	(_aes_crypt): Moved reading of ctx->nrounds out of the loop.
	(_aes_crypt): In final_loop, deleted a redundant mov, and use i as
	loop variable.
	(_aes_crypt): Started renumbering registers in the inner loop. The
	computation for the table[j] sub-expression should be kept in
	register %o[j].
	(_aes_crypt): Renamed more variables in the inner loop. Now the
	primary variables are t0, t1, t2, t3.

	* sparc/aes.asm (_aes_crypt): Swapped register %i0 and %o5, %i1
	and %o0, %i2 and %o4, %i3 and %o3, %i4 and %o2.
	(_aes_crypt): wtxt was stored in both %l1 and %l2 for the entire
	function. Freed %l2 for other uses.
	(_aes_crypt): Likewise for tmp, freeing register %o1.	

	* sparc/machine.m4: New file, for sparc-specific macros.

	* sparc/aes.asm (_aes_crypt): Hacked the source_loop, to get rid
	of yet another redundant loop variable, and one instruction.
	(_aes_crypt): Strength reduce loop variable in the
	inner loop, getting rid of one register.
	(_aes_crypt): Use pre-shifted indices (aes_table.idx_shift), to
	avoid some shifts in the inner loop.
	(_aes_crypt): Don't check for nrounds==0 at the start of the loop.

	* asm.m4: Define and use structure-defining macros.

	* Makefile.am (%.asm): Use a GNU pattern rule, to make %.o depend
	on both %.asm and asm.m4.

	* aes-internal.h (struct aes_table): New subtable idx_shift.
	Updated tables in aes_encrypt.c and aes_decrypt.c.

	* asm.m4: Use eval to compute values.

	* sparc/aes.asm (_aes_crypt): Deleted commented out old version of
	the code.

	and aes_set_decrypt_key.

	* sparc/aes.asm (_aes_crypt): Use symbolic names for the fucntion
	arguments. 

2002-02-14  Niels Möller  <nisse@cuckoo.hack.org>

	* sparc/aes.asm: Copied gcc assembler code for _aes_crypt.

	* aes-internal.h (struct aes_table): New structure, including all
	constant tables needed by the unified encryption or decryption
	function _aes_crypt.

	* aes.c (_aes_crypt): New function, which unifies encryption and
	decryption.

	AES key setup now uses two separate functions for setting
	encryption and decryption keys. Applications that don't do
	decryption need no inverted subkeys and no code to generate them.
	Similarly, the tables (about 4K each for encryption and
	decryption), are put into separate files.

	* aes.h (struct aes_ctx): Deleted space for inverse subkeys. For
	decryption, the inverse subkeys replace the normal subkeys, and
	they are stored _in the order they are used_. 

	* aes-set-key.c (aes_set_key): Deleted file, code moved...
	* aes-set-decrypt-key.c, aes-set-encrypt-key.c: New files,
	separated normal and inverse key setup.

	* aes-tables.c: Deleted, tables moved elsewhere...
	* aes-encrypt.c, aes-decrypt.c: New files; moved encryption and
	decryption funktions, and needed tables, into separate files.

	* aes.c (aes_decrypt): Rewrote to use the bigger tables.

2002-02-12  Niels Möller  <nisse@cuckoo.hack.org>

	final round.

	* aes.c (aes_encrypt): Optionally use smaller rotating inner loop.

	* aes-tables.c (dtbl): Replaced with table generated by aesdata.

	avoid rotates.

	* sparc/aes.asm (aes_encrypt): Strength reduced on j, getting rid
	of one register and one instruction in the inner loop.

	* sparc/aes.asm (idx, aes_encrypt): Multiplied tabled values by 4,
	making it possible to get rid of some shifts in the inner loop.

	* configure.in: Fixed spelling of --enable-assembler. Commented
	out debug echo:s.

	* asm.m4: New file. For now, only doing changequote and changecom.

	saving one redundant register pointing to idx.
	(idx_row): New macro. Include asm.m4.

	(libnettle_a_SOURCES): Added new rsa and aes files.

	* configure.in: New command line option --enable-assembler.
	Selects assembler code depending on the host system.

	* rsa-decrypt.c, rsa-encrypt.c: New files for rsa pkcs#1
	encryption. 

	* aes-set-key.c, aes-tables.c: New files, split off from aes.c.

	* aes-internal.h: New file.

	* cast128-meta.c (_NETTLE_CIPHER_FIX): Use _NETTLE_CIPHER_FIX. 

	* cbc.c (cbc_decrypt_internal): New function, doing the real CBC
	procesing and requiring that src != dst.
	(cbc_decrypt): Use cbc_decrypt_internal. If src == dst, use a
	buffer of limited size to copy the ciphertext.

	key size in bits.

	ciphers with a fixed key size.

	* examples/nettle-benchmark.c (display): New function for
	displaying the results, including MB/s figures.
