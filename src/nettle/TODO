Public key support, analogous to that provided by RSAREF. Suggested by
Dan Egnor. Signatures are done now, but RSA encryption is still
missing. References:

More feedback modes, in order of decreasing priority:  CBC-MAC, OFB,
Counter, and CFB. Suggested by Rafael 'Dido' Sevilla. References:

Improve sexp_Format to accept literals, like "n" in

  sexp_format(buffer, "(n%b)", n);

Add a "avanced-hex" syntax to sexp-conv. Like the advanced syntax, but
prefer hex instead of base 64 for non-ascii literals.
