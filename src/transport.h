 * Processing functions may deallocate their input packets and
 * allocate fresh packets to pass on; therefore, any data from a
 * packet that is needed later must be copied into some other storage.
 *
 * At any time, each packet is own by a a particular processing
 * function. Pointers into a packet are valid only while you own it.
