	* src/server_session.c (make_pty): Simple bugfix, pty->master was

	process of the lshd server (if it's running in daemonic mode).
	(pty_open_slave): Renamed function tty_setctty. Now responsible
	also for opening the slave side of the pty, pushing STREAMS

	(sftp_read_packet): Call clearerr after checking for error and
	eof.
