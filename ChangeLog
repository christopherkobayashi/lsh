	* configure.in: Clarified comment. Added several warnings.

	* keyexchange.c (select_algorithm): Had a terminiation condition
 	"i < LIST_LENGTH(client_list) >= 0" in a for loop, which is
 	probably nonsensical. Removed >= 0 part.

	* lsh_types.h: Introduced UNUSED annotation. Enable GNU libc
	extensions. Note: lsh_types.h must be included before any system header
	for this to work properly.

	* Makefile.am.in: Make gperf produce ANSI C output, and postprocess it
	to fully initialise wordlist.

	* lshd.c, lsh.c: Added a short usage string.

 	passwords, by Keresztfalvi Gabor Agoston <kg230@hszk.bme.hu>.

	EOF. 

	* xalloc.c (lsh_object_clone): New function.

	* server_keyexchange.c (do_init_dh): Copy the server key (as
	strings can't be shared).

	* crypto.c (do_sha_copy, ): Use the CLONE macro instead of memcpy to
	copy instances.
	(do_hmac_copy): -"-

Fri Dec  4 02:30:28 1998    <nisse@puck>

	* (practically every file): Adapted to new gc and object system.

	* xalloc.c (lsh_object_check_subtype): Allow NULL pointers. They
	are occasionally permissible (for instance, the NULL crypto
	algorithm), and when they aren't the error will be detected early
	anyway. 
	(lsh_object_check): -"-

	* keyexchange.c (do_handle_kexinit): Use an object_list for
 	passing around the selected algorithms. The void ** that was used
 	earlier was unfriendly to the gc.

	* lsh.c (main): Bug fix (pass *address* of crypto_rc4_algorithm).
 	Thanks to Keresztfalvi Gabor Agoston <kg230@hszk.bme.hu>.

	* lsh_types.h: Moved definitions of UINT* to
	include/crypto_types.h.

	* io.c: Use Sean Reifschneider's poll-by-select emulation if
	poll() is unavailable.
