Signature algorithm: DSA, as defined in FIPS 186-3, using SHA256 for
the hash function.

Algorithm name: "ssh-dsa-sha256@lysator.liu.se" (suggested name
"ssh-dsa-sha256" if/when registered with iana). Rational: "ssh-"
prefix because we use ssh-specific encodings of keys and signatures.
dsa since that's the name of the algorithm, and then "-sha256" since
the algorithm description is parameterized by the hash function.

Public-key format:

      string    "ssh-dsa"
      mpint     p
      mpint     q
      mpint     g
      mpint     y

Except for the name, this syntax is the same as for "ssh-dss". When
used for the algorithm ssh-dsa-sha256, the prime q must be exactly 256
bits. The prime p is expected to be of size between 1024 and 3072 bits
(do we need to specify exactly which key sizes should be supported by
an implementation advertising this signature algorithm? We don't do
that for any other signature algorithm, as far as I know).

Signature format:

      string    "ssh-dsa"
      mpint	r
      mpint	s

This departs from the signature_blob thing used for other signature
algorithms. It's intended that this signature format should be useful
for all variants of dsa, with any hash function.

As far as I'm aware, there's no need to add any local-suffix to the
names included in the key and signature formats.
