NEWS for the 1.8 release

	New name mangling, to reduce the risk of link collisions. All
	functions (except memxor) now use a nettle_ or _nettle prefix
	when seen by the linker. For most functions, the header file
	that declares a function also use #define to provide a shorter
	more readable name without the prefix.

NEWS for the 1.7 release

	Implemented DSA.

	Renamed RSA functions for consistency. Now it's
	rsa_public_key_init, not rsa_init_public_key, etc.

	Both RSA and DSA now have sign/verify functions that take the
	hash digest as argument.

	A rewritten and much more powerful sexp-conv program.

	Other changes to the sexp code, in particular updating it to
	the latest SPKI draft.

	Building nettle as a shared library (ELF only) seems to work.
	The version number is increased, so the library "soname" for
	this release is "libnettle.so.1".

	Bugfixes. Fixes for build and portability problems.

NEWS for the 1.6 release

	Optimized assembler implementations of aes, for sparc and x86.

	The aes interface has changed slightly. The function
	aes_set_key is no more. Instead one has to use
	aes_set_encrypt_key or aes_set_decrypt_key. Sorry about that. 

	New example programs, rsa-keygen, rsa-sign and rsa-verify,
	located in the examples directory.

	New configure option --enable-shared, which builds a shared
	library. Not tested.

	New experimental features, including sexp parsing and
	formatting, and changes to base64 encoding and decoding. The
	interfaces to these functions are subject to change, and are
	documented only in the source code.
	
NEWS for the 1.5 release

	RSA support. Key generation and signatures.
	
	Support for HMAC (RFC-2104).

	An implementation of the Yarrow-256 PRNG.

	New sections in the manual.
	
	Changed the interface for hash functions. The md5_digest
	function is now equivalent to the old sequence of md5_final,
	md5_digest, md5_init, and similarly for the other hashing
	algorithms. This makes the interface simpler.

NEWS for the 1.0 release

	Fixed twofish bug spotted by Jean-Pierre Stierlin.

	Added des3 and cbc.
	
	New RFC-1321-like interface in nettle/md5-compat.h, suggested
	by Assar Westerlund.

	New libdes-style compatibility interface in nettle/des-compat.h.
