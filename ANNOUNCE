I'd like to announce a new version of LSH, the GNU implementation of
the secure shell protocols. LSH includes a client, a server, and a few
scripts and utility programs.


FEATURES

Some of the LSH-1.0 features are

o  Strong encryption and data authentication.

o  Strong host authentication using public key techniques.

o  User authentication by either ordinary UN*X passwords
   or public key techniques.

o  Spawning of remote shells and commands, including pseudo tty support.

o  Forwarding of TCP connections, in both directions.

o  Zlib compression.

o  Experimental support for Secure REmote Password (SRP) authentication.

o  Experimental support for IPv6.

o  A draft manual.


COMPATIBILITY AND PORTABILITY

LSH implements the secsh protocol as defined by the latest drafts from
the IETF secsh working group. It interoperates with both SSH Inc's
SSH2 products and OpenSSH. Note that LSH is *not* compatible with
SSH1, although the lshd deamon can fall back to an SSH1 implementation
(e.g. OpenSSH or Datafellow's) when an ssh1 client connects.

LSH is reported to have worked at least once on GNU/Linux on Sparc,
Intel and Alpha, FreeBSD, Solaris and IRIX. There may well be
portability problems left, please report them to me.


QUALITY

However, LSH does *NOT* try to provide any security on systems that
lack a good /dev/random. LSH is provided AS IS, ABSOLUTELY no
GUARANTEES, etc. Please report any bugs you find.


PLANNED FEATURES

Some features that are planned but not yet implemented are

o  A good, portable, (pseudo) randomness source.

o  A "gateway" interface, to let external programs access an LSH
   connection easily and securely.

o  Forwarding of X, ssh-agent, UDP.

o  Support for SPKI certificates, for both authorization and host
   authentication. 

o  Kerberos authentication.

o  A file transfer service.

Public License. Unlike other secsh implementations, you can use LSH
freely for any purpose.


AVAILABILITY AND FURTHER INFORMATION

The main LSH archive is located at

  ftp://ftp.lysator.liu.se/pub/security/lsh

Discussions about LSH takes place on the psst mailing list. See the
psst home page, http://www.net.lut.ac.uk/psst, for details.


Happy hacking,
