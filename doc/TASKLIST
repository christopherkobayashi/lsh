This file describes some mostly independent subprojects for lsh.
Before starting on any of them, please contact me (Niels Möller
<nisse@lysator.liu.se); someone may already be working on it already,
and we need to coordinate.


Port forwarding services
  TCP,
  X,
  ssh-agent,
  UDP (not in the spec, but that's no reason why it couldn't be
       implemented).

PTY support.

Compression (zlib) support.

User interface. This includes command line options, configuration
files, an escape-character mechanism and any features attached to that,
including a command mode to create or terminate forwarded ports and
channels interactively.

More user authentication methods; in particular the public-key method.

Key storage, generation and management.

SPKI support. Using SPKI certificates to grant access for groups and
individuals seems seems like a good thing to me (even if I suspect
that its usefulness is greater for more specialized services than
login). I also find it appealing to send SPKI hashed key id:s rather
than the public keys themselves in the publickey authentication
protocol.

SSH agent (does anybody have a specification of the protocol(s) used
by ssh-agent?)


Projects not to do:

PAM support. (Looked at it. Didn't like it. See NOTES for details).
