  <h1> TODO for LSH-3.0 </h1>
  <p> This is an attempt at defining a development target for
  LSH-3.0, inspired by similar pages for recent GMP releases. [Last
  updated 2012-07-14]</p>
  <p class='should'>
    This really ought to be done before release
  </p>
  <p class='wish'>
    Try to get this done before release
  </p>
  <p class='done'>
    Done!
  </p>
  <p class='postponed'>
    Leave for some later release!
  </p>
  <h2> TODO </h2>
  <p class='should'>
    Upgrade license to GPL-v3 (except for libspki)
  </p>
  <p class='should'>
    Support for configuring algorithm lists in <tt>lshd.conf</tt>.
  </p>
  <p class='wish'>
    Use spki acls for user authentication, rather than the current
    <tt>~/.lsh/authorized_keys_sha1/</tt> hack.
  </p>
  <p class='wish'>
    In the <tt>lsh</tt> client, don't unlock password protected keys
    unless they're going to be used. Also support ssh-agent/gpg-agent.
  </p>
  <p class='should'>
    Re-add zlib support.
