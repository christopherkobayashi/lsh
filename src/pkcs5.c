/* NOTE: The PKCS#5 v2 spec doesn't recommend or specify any
 * particular value of the iteration count.
 *
 * To get a feeling for reasonable ranges, I've done some benchmarking
 * on my system, an old SparcStation 4 with a bogomips rating of about
 * 110. For testing, I'm using SHA1-HMAC with the password = "gazonk",
 * salt = "pepper", and I generate a 32 octet key, suitable for
 * triple-DES CBC.
 *
 * Measured timings:
 *
 *    Iterations    Elapsed time (seconds)
 *             1            0.02
 *            10            0.02
 *           100            0.06
 *          1000            0.35
 *        10 000            3.27
 *       100 000           33.36
 *      1000 000          330.84
 *
 * What is reasonable?
 *
 * With 1000 iterations, key derivation is still doable (and probably
 * almost bearable) on slow machines. A real slow i386 could be 50
 * times slower than my machine, and 1000 iterations might take 20
 * seconds.
 *
 * On the other hand, the key derivation involved in a small
 * dictionary attack trying 10000 passwords would take about an hour
 * on my machine. And perhaps only a few minutes on a modern office
 * machine.
 *
 * Based on this, it seems that something between 1000 and 10000 is a
 * reasonable number of iterations (today, May 2000). */
