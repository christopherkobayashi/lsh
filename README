LSH - a GNU implementation of the Secure Shell protocols.

INSTALLATION

If you have downloaded a release, you should be able to compile it
with

   ./configure
   make

You need GNU make. Some shells have had bugs preventing them from
executing the configure script; if you experience problems, try
running

  bash configure

If you want to hack lsh, you need some more tools: autoconf (at least
version 2.50), automake (at least version 1.6), bash, gcc, gperf (at
least version 2.7) and a scheme implementation. The currently
supported schemes are guile and scsh (at least version 0.5.2). All but
scsh can be found at your local GNU mirror site. scsh, Olin Shiver's
Scheme Shell, can be downloaded from <URL:
ftp://ftp-swiss.ai.mit.edu/pub/su/scsh/scsh.tar.gz>. If you use guile,
you also need the slib library, which is usually distributed
separately. It's also available at the GNU mirrors.

If you have checked out lsh from CVS, things are more complicated. You
must first generate Makefile.am files from the corresponding
Makefile.am.in files. Do this by running ./make_am in the top level
directory. Next, you need to run aclocal, autoconf, autoheader and
automake -a. This creates the configure script and a Makefile.in. Now
you can try ./configure ; make. If the compiler complains that it
can't find a file foo.h.x, try creating it with make foo.h.x, and
similarly for missing foo.c.x files. The misc/bootstrap.sh script
tries to do all this.


NEEDED LIBRARIES

GMP (version 3.1 or better) can be found at ftp.gnu.org, or some of
its mirrors.

ZLIB can be found at http://www.zlib.org. Latest version is
zlib-1.1.4, earlier versions of zlib have a known security problem, so
make sure you get version 1.1.4 or later.

liboop (version 0.8 or better) can be found at www.liboop.org.


GETTING STARTED

After install, the first thing you need to do is creating a seed-file
for the randomness generator. Use

  lsh-make-seed

to create a personal seed file. If you want to run the lshd server,
you also need to run

  lsh-make-seed-file --server

as root.

Some examples...

Create a new DSS key pair, and save it in NEW_KEY and NEW_KEY.pub:

  ./lsh-keygen  -l 8 | ./lsh-writekey -o NEW_KEY

Start an lshd server on port 4711, using the key created above as the
server host key:

  ./lshd -p 4711 -h NEW_KEY

Connect to an lshd server running on port 4711 on HOST, and attempt to
log in as USER:

  ./lsh -p 4711 -l USER HOST
