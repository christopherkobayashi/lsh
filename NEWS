News for the 0.2.7 release

	Bug fixes for compialtion on Solaris.

News for the 0.2.6 release

	Bugfixes for tcp forwarding functions.

	Some more tests for testsuite. To try them, you must first
	setup lsh so that you can login with no password. Then type
	"make check-more" in the testsuite subdirectory. 
	
News for the 0.2.5 release

	Bugfixes.

News for the 0.2.3 release

	Added lshd options --password, --no-password, --publickey and
	--no-publickey, for configuring the set of supported userauth
	methods.

	Changes to the proxy program (Bazsi).

News for the 0.2.2 release

	Bug fixes. Verbose messages on algorithm selection.

News for the 000.2 release

	Bugfixes. New --pty-support and --no-pty-support options for
	lshd.

News for the lsh-0.1.20 release

	Bugfixes. New test script for lsh_writekey.

News for the lsh-0.1.19 release

	Lots of bugfixes. Reading of ~/.lsh/known_hosts and
	~/.lsh/identity seems to work.

	New contrib sub-directory.
	
News for the lsh-0.1.18 release

	lsh now reads ACL:s from the ~/.lsh/known_hosts file.

	First attempt at a m4-based testsuite. It depends on m4 being
	able to handle the eight-bit quote characters » and «. If your
	m4 doesn't do that, get the latest beta of GNU m4 or recompile
	GNU m4-1.4 with CFLAGS=-funsigned-char.

News for the lsh-0.1.17 release

	More support for host authentication and SPKI.

	First version that includes Bazsi's work on an ssh-proxy (i.e.
	a program that implements the traditional Man-in-the-middle
	attack on the ssh2 protocol). Could be useful for people
	running firewalls, and also for those of us who want to point
	out that it's a bad idea to use unauthenticated hostkeys.

News for the lsh-0.1.16 release

	Some preparations for real host authentication.
	
News for the lsh-0.1.15 release

	Support for publickey user authentication.

	A new script lsh-authorize.

News for the lsh-0.1.14 release

	First try on daemonization support.

	Better tracing; try --trace to get some more information than
	with -v, but without all the boring information generated by
	--debug.

	Generally nicer options and help mesasges, thanks to argp.

	Better handling of i/o exceptions. lshd should no longer crash
	when connections behave unexpectedly.

News for the lsh-0.1.12 release

	Tried to fix bugs related to channel close. In the process,
	improved the resource mechanism, and let each channel
	have it's own list of resources.

	Fixed configure.in to handle systems with neither scsh or
	guile installed.
	

News for the lsh-0.1.11 release

	Support for other scheme implementations in the build process,
	in particular guile.
	

News for the lsh-0.1.10 release

	Fixed bug in sexp parser and lsh_writekey.

	Merged more of bazsis patches.
	

News for the lsh-0.1.9 release

	Lot's of bug fixes. This version actually seems to work.

	Bazsi's public key patches is in, although I haven't been able
	to test them.

	The SEXP parser is rewritten to use the new exception
	framework. The program that makes the most of of this right
	now is lsh_writekey. Its core reads like

     (params
       (private object io_write_file_info)
       (public object io_write_file_info))
     
     (lambda (backend)
       (let ((key (read (stdin backend))))
         (prog1 (transport (open backend public) (private2public key))
                ; FIXME: Add encryption here
                (canonical (open backend private) key))))))
	
	The sexptest program has been renamed to sexp_conv. It reads
	an sexp (for now, only canonical and transport syntax are
	supported) on stdin, and prints it using advanced, transport
	or canonical syntax. More features could be added.

	The --debug option now dumps both sent and received packets,
	and it includes a human readable name of the packet type.
	Packets of type SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST are suppressed,
	however, because they typically contains user passwords.

	There is one known bug: Running without pty allocation (lsh
	-nt) doesn't work, at least not for me.

	
News for the lsh-0.1.8 release

	Reworked all the error handling to use exceptions. No new
	features, but lots of new bugs.

There are no official releases numbered 0.1.4 -- 0.1.7. However,
these version numbers are used for Bazsi's unofficial releases during
the summer. The unofficial releases feature public key user
authentication and better compatibility with Datafellow's ssh2
products. 

News for the lsh-0.1.3 release

	Local forwarding (-L) works. -R is slightly broken.

News for the lsh-0.1.2 release

	First user visible tcpforwarding (-L option). Not tested
	yet...

	Fixed flow control.

	DSA signatures should conform better both to the draft andd to
	the ssh-2.x implementations.

	Better handling of POLLHUP.
	
News for the lsh-0.1 release

	Added compiler.scm to the dist.

	Changed the session key generation to comply with the latest
	draft (pointed out by Joseph Galbraith).

	Added IDEA support (Bazsi).

	Fixes to pty handling and flow control (mostly Bazsi). 

	Fixed the client side handling of userauth failures.

	By default, if we are running with a pty, use the same fd for
	stdout and stderr. This workaround should make lsh more
	friendly to bash and other programs that expect stderr to be a
	tty.

NEWS for the 1999-04-25 snapshot:

	Fixed a few bugs in pty and eof handling. Should now work
	about as well as the 03-17 snapshot. Also removed most old
	#if:ed out code.

	Bugfixes.

NEWS for the 1999-03-08 snapshot

	No user visible changes. Added a instance variable to keep
	track of the amount of buffered data in the write_buffer
	objects (needed to fix the broken flow control).

	Added a generic doubly linked list, currently used by the
	write_buffer and resource_list classes, but which will be
	needed for more things (see the CONTROL item on the TODO
        list). 

NEWS for the 1999-03-07 snapshot

	Improved CFMAKERAW. Ugly fix for the UNIX98-style pty:s
	support.

	Twofish support (not quite working).

NEWS for the 1998-12-21 snapshot:

Moved most objects in crypto.c and abstract_crypto.c into separate

Added a workaround for Datafellows ssh2 client, which (contrary to the
specification) asks for protocol version 1.99.

Use /dev/urandom, if available.

Collect most object files into liblsh.a.

Started on a key generation program.

TASKLIST and NOTES files now included in the snapshot.


NEWS since the 1998-12-17 snapshot:

Support for md5 (by Balázs Scheidler).

Various bugfixes.


NEWS since the 1998-12-11 snapshot:

A resource mechanism (resource.[ch]) used by the server to cleanup
properly when a connection dies unexpectedly. Can be used to kill
child processes, close files and ports, etc.

Generic code for chaining ciphers (crypto_cbc()) and piping them
together (crypto_cascade()).

Some untested support for blowfish and 3DES. A -c command line option
is needed.

A few bugfixes. Thanks to J.H.M. Dassen (Ray) and Balázs Scheidler.
