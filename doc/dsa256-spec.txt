Signature algorithm: DSA, as defined in FIPS 186-3, using SHA256 for
the hash function.

Algorithm name: "ssh-dsa-sha256@lysator.liu.se" (suggested name
"ssh-dsa-sha256" if/when registered with iana). Rational: "ssh-"
prefix because we use ssh-specific encodings of keys and signatures.
dsa since that's the name of the algorithm, and then "-sha256" since
the algorithm description is parameterized by the hash function.

Public-key format:

      string    "ssh-dsa-sha256"
      mpint     p
      mpint     q
      mpint     g
      mpint     y

Except for the name, this syntax is the same as for "ssh-dss". The
prime q must be exactly 256 bits. The prime p is expected to be of
size between 1024 and 3072 bits (do we need to specify exactly which
key sizes should be supported by an implementation advertising this
signature algorithm? We don't do that for any other signature
algorithm, as far as I know).

Signature format:

      string    "ssh-dsa-sha256"
      string    dsa_signature_blob

The dsa_signature blob is a string with a 64-octets payload, where the
first 32 represent r, unsigned and in network byte order, and the next
32 octets represent s. (I'd prefer to depart from this
"signature_blob" thing and instead use separate mpints for r and s,
but I think it's more important to stay consistent with the other
signature algorithms.

As far as I'm aware, there's no need to add any local-suffix to the
names included in the key and signature formats.
