NEWS since the 1998-12-11 snapshot:

A resource mechanism (resource.[ch]) used by the server to cleanup
properly when a connection dies unexpectedly. Can be used to kill
child processes, close files and ports, etc.

Generic code for chaining ciphers (crypto_cbc()) and piping them
together (crypto_cascade()).

Some untested support for blowfish and 3DES. A -c command line option
is needed.

A few bugfixes. Thanks to J.H.M. Dassen (Ray) and Balazs Scheidler.
