S-EXPRESSIONS

Change the format used for encrypted private key to include the public
key as well. This way, the private key can be decrypted on-demand.
This seems cleaner than having the client read both identity and
identity.pub.


USERS

Implement a general user-database abstraction. Also have a look at
'Pluggable Non Interactive Authentication Modules' at
http://www.msu.ru/pniam/pniam.html.

Log a message if user authentication fails because root is not allowed
to log in.

Create an --telnet-mode/--auth-by-login option to lshd, which will
accept a none-authentication, but instead of forking a login shell for
the user, it should fork a /bin/login running as root with options to
make it display a password prompt.


CHARSETS

The conversion from UTF8->unicode->latin1 doesn't handle accented
characters properly. Probably needs a complete rewrite.

Check out GNU libidn.


CONFIGURATION

Figure out what configuration files we need. 


LOGGING

Use syslog to log server startup, shutdown, and user authentication.


SERVER ISSUES

For compatibility with other sshd:s and bash, lshd should set some
more environment variables when starting user processes.

  SSH_CLIENT=<client-ip> <client-port> <server-port>
  SSH_TTY=<tty-name> (if a pty was allocated)
  SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND

bash looks at SSH_CLIENT, and reads .bashrc if it is set.


ALLOCATION

Have the allocator initialize all objects automatically.

Unify the debug malloc system to add a magic number to every block
header, with distinct values for space, strings, objects and lists.


OBJECT SYSTEM

Better typechecking of non-heap objects. To do this one would also
need valid isa-pointers in classes (as classes are statically
allocated). If this is done properly, the meta feature could also be
cleaned up a little.

Consider adding "const" methods. One such method to use that for is
ALIST_GET.

Make sure that the first (self) argument to the method-like macros
never have side effects.


CHANNELS

The following bug should be eliminated: I use lshg to get a large
file,

  src/lshg -v --trace --debug >lsh-test.log.gz sture.lysator.liu.se
  cat 'incoming/lsh-test.log.gz' 2>lshg.log

The file is 0x614ef9 bytes, but only 0x610000 bytes gets through.
Looking at the lshg log, the final SSH_MSG_DATA packet(s) is missing,
so the data is lost either in lsh, or in the remote opensshd.


FORWARDING

Generalize the -L and -R options to
[<source-ip>:]<source-port>:<target-ip>:<target-port>
where the first component is optional.

Implement other types of forwarding; ssh-agent, UDP, etc.

Review the naming of functions in tcpforward.c; it appears a little
inconsistent. 


RANDOMNESS

Look at prngd,
http://www.aet.tu-cottbus.de/personen/jaenicke/postfix_tls/prngd.html
(recommended by Oystein Viggen <oysteivi@tihlde.org>), and perhaps
also at egd.


SPKI ISSUES

Use the name "rsa-pkcs1" consistently for all keys, and perhaps
include the name of the hash function in the signature objects.
  

DENIAL OF SERVICE

Review how much cpu and memory a malicious client can consume at the
server.


BUILD ISSUES

Have autoconf automatically add -I $prefix/include and -L $prefix/lib ?

The definition of SBINDIR is broken, in gets the value
"${exec_prefix}/sbin".

Use separate version.h.in and version.h files, to avoid rebuilding
everything when the version number is increased.


PROTOCOL ISSUES

Update the signal-related messages to conform to
draft-ietf-secsh-connect-08.txt.

Some SSH Inc sshd server sends USERAUTH_FAILURE messages with a
trailing ",", like "publickey,password,". Consider hacking
parse.c:parse_next_atom to allow that.

The server currently allows the client to send random banner text
before its version string. Such text is not allowed by the protocol
spec.


USER INTERFACE ISSUES

Hack do_spki_decrypt() in spki_commands.c to ask again if the provided
password is incorrect.

Implement an escape char, like ~ with rsh.

The --interface option to lshd can only handle numeric ip addresses.


TESTING

The testsuite is far from complete. Some parts that it misses are

 * Sending and receiving of SSH_MSG_REQUEST_FAILURE and
   SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_FAILURE.

 * Same for SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_OPEN_FAILURE.

 * All SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_EXTENDED_DATA (i.e. stderr data)

 * Failed key exchanges. SRP key exchange.

 * PTY allocation, requests, etc.

 * Userauth banner, failures, kerberos password helper.

 * connection_handle_pending(), connection_ignore_handler,
   connection_fail_handler, connection_unimplemented_handler,
   connection_forward_handler.

 * Gatewayed channel requests and global requests.

 * lsh-export-key.
   
 * sexp-conv with options --select, --*-hash.

 * sexp display types.

 * spki, tag prefix and tag any.

 * TCP forwarding: cancel-tcpip-forward, various exception.

 * utmp logging.


MISC

Try to find out why read() sometimes returns -1 and sets errno==EPIPE,
on sparc-linux, 2.0.33, redhat-5.1, glibc. Note: Debian's sparc port
uses glibc2.1, rather than 2.0; maybe Red Hat does too? Quite a lot of
things have changed between 2.0 and 2.1; this might well be a
documented feature of 2.1.

Make it cleaner wrt. more gcc warnings.

Fix desTest.c to use proper declarations of its function pointers, and
have autoconf check for rusage().

It seems that it is a little difficult to detect that an asyncronous
connect() failed; poll() indicates that both reading and writing is
possible, but write fails (with EPIPE/SIGPIPE) later. Perhaps a
linux-problem?

Perhaps some of the dh-code in publickey_crypto should be moved to
keyexchange.c?

Fix the src/symmetric/desTest program. It doesn't complain if the
desCode is compiled with empty keymap.h, parity.h and rotors.h files.

About POLLHUP:

  I've found something that can either be an io.c or a linux kernel bug.
  This time it is the poll() system call, which causes troubles. If an
  AF_UNIX connection is closed by the client, the kernel doesn't set
  POLLIN in revents, instead it sets only POLLHUP. (and therefore the io
  backend doesn't read the last zero length packet) The following patch
  solves the problem for me:
  
  -        if (fds[i].revents & POLLIN)
  -          READ_FD(fd);
  +        if (fds[i].revents & (POLLIN | POLLHUP))
  +          READ_FD(fd);
  
  jpoll.h doesn't define POLLHUP, so I added a
  
  #define POLLHUP         0
  
  line there. I seldom use poll() so I don't know what the correct
  behaviour should be, but I am afraid this is a kernel bug again.

  Bazsi

Find out why opening /dev/ptmx fails occasionally (errno = 19, no
such device).

Add some workaround for the poll()-bug in linux/glibc-2.07 reported by
Bazsi. Hmm, this is probably not a bug. I have to find out what the
right way is to handle the poll conditions POLLERR, POLLHUP and
POLLERR. 

Consider removing the write-attribute from ssh_channel.

Let init_channel take enough arguments to initialize the window- and
packet-size fields properly. It's too easy to forget them.

Add const to arguments of type struct exception_handler *?

Do something reasonable in do_buffered_read() if want_read is cleared.

The supplied argp is compiled even if it isn't used.

Move miscellaneous lsh_string-functions from format.c to a separate
file.

Consider moving SPKI tuple-related functions to a separate file.

With SPKI, consider whether or not we should require any specific
order of subexpressions. The most central function for this is
sexp_get_un. 

Add -f, to fork and exit when userauthentication is done and any
tunneling is set up.

Consider using dynamically allocated strings for exception messages.
Without this, it is impossible to use non-constant messages, for
instance messages supplied by the peer.

Try to unify the handling of queued channel requests and global
requests. 

Get rid of the double close loop in io_iter. Perhaps start using a
doubly linked list for fds? Add a backend-pointer to fd:s? Use an
extra stack of fds that should be closed?

If we add the backend field to lsh_fd objects, the code for listen
could also be simplified, and perhaps we can get rid of the backend
pointer in some other places as well.

Should lsh fail if some port forwardings fails? In particular,

  $ lsh -R... -N

is pretty useless if the server doesn't let us bind the remote port.

Add reasonable limits to all calls to parse_bignum(), sexp2bignum_u()
and sexp_get_un().

There are dsa-specific details in many places, lsh.c
server_publickey.c, server_authorization.c, server_keyexchange.c. Try
to write more generic functions that can deal with both dsa and rsa.

Review the default algorithm preference list in
algorithms.c:default_crypto_algorithms(). Perhaps make the list more
conservative, and add a "pseudo-algorithm" all to include all
supported algorithms in the list?

Use static objects for crypto algorithms with fixed key sizes and
other parameters.

Replace most defines with enums, for improved type checking.

Write more testcases for rsa.

Perhaps change the LOOKUP_VERIFIER method to return an spki_subject?

Make connection_unlock install a callout that calls
connection_handle_pending(). 

Consider how much we really need to differentiate between
rsa-pkcs1-sha1 / rsa-pkcs1-md5 and between spki-sign-rsa /
spki-sign-dss.

Building fails if srp support is disabled. The building of srp-gen
must be conditionalized.

lshg -L doesn't work. The lsh process dies on the first connection to
the forwarded port. Hmm. Or rather, it seems that the remote server
(opensshd) disconnects.

A successful tcp-forwarding (set up using lsh -L... -N):

make_char_classes seems not to work with guile-1.3.4. Bug in guile?

: ERROR: Two copies of (leaf #f (#\377)) (leaf #f (#\377))
: make[1]: *** [sexp_table.h] Error 2

or

: ERROR: Stack overflow
: make: *** [sexp_table.h] Error 2

Figure out whether or not to make --cvs-workaround the default.
According to Neil Jarram, "lsh-1.1.2 with --cvs-workaround=oe always
succeeds." Update: According to rms, --cvs-workaround=e works, and
--cvs-workaround=o doesn't, so it seems that it's stderr that causes
problems. So we need to avoid setting stderr into non-blocking mode.

Add a keep-alive option, which sends SSH_MSG_IGNORE at regular
intervals.

The lshd --daemonic option doesn't work with the
RANDOM_POLL_BACKGROUND.

: Strange. A guess on what's happening:
: 
:   1. lshd starts a background process for collecting randomness,
: 
:   2. next it forks and exits to get into the background,
: 
:   3. it tries to waitpid the process created in 1, but it's no longer
:      the parent of that process, so waiting fails.

When a forwarding created with lshg -L ... goes down (at the local
end, I think), the channel is not taken down properly, and there are a
lot of "lsh: write_buffer: Attempt to write data to closed buffer."
warnings by lsh:

: bash-2.03$ lshg: Exiting: Connection reset by peer
: lsh: write_buffer: Attempt to write data to closed buffer.
: lsh: write_buffer: Attempt to write data to closed buffer.

To fix this, we must put some resources on the lsh's
gateway-connection's resource list, that closes the chained
connections. 

According to rms, lsh is significantly slower than ssh when logging in
over a slow connection. Figure out why.
