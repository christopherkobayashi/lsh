I'd like to announce a new version of LSH, the GNU implementation of
the secure shell protocols. LSH includes a client, a server, and a few
scripts and utility programs.


FEATURES

Some of the LSH-0.9 features are

o  Strong encryption and data authentication.

o  Strong host authentication using public key techniques.

o  Spawning of remote shells, including pseudo tty support.

o  Forwarding of TCP connections, in both directions.

o  User authentication by either ordinary UN*X passwords
   or public key techniques.

o  Zlib compression.

o  A draft manual.


COMPATIBILITY AND PORTABILITY

LSH implements the secsh protocol as defined by the latest drafts from
the IETF secsh working group. It is also bug-compatible with
Datafellow's SSH2 products. Note that LSH is *not* compatible with
SSH1, although the lshd deamon can fall back to an SSH1 implementation
(e.g. OpenSSH or Datafellow's) when an ssh1 client connects.

LSH is reported to have worked at least once on GNU/Linux on Sparc and
Intel, FreeBSD, Solaris and IRIX. There may well be portability
problems left, please report them to me.


QUALITY

However, LSH does *NOT* try to provide any security on systems that
lack a good /dev/random. LSH-0.9 should be considered a beta release;
use on production systems is not recommended. LSH is provided AS IS,
ABSOLUTELY no GUARANTEES, etc. Please report any bugs you find.


PLANNED FEATURES

Some features that are planned but not yet implemented are

o  Execution of remote commands (like rsh).

o  A "gateway" interface, to let external programs access an LSH
   connection easily and securely.

o  Forwarding of X, ssh-agent, UDP.

o  Support for SPKI certificates, for both authorization and host
   authentication. 

o  Support for the Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol.

o  Kerberos authentication.

o  A file transfer service.

o  IPv6 support.

Happy hacking,
