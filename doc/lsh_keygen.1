.TH lsh_keygen 1 "JANUARY 1999" LSH "Lsh Manuals"
.SH NAME
lsh_keygen \- Generate a public, private key pair.
.SH DISCLAIMER
LSH IS WORK IN PROGRESS. DON'T EXPECT THE CURRENT VERSION TO WORK, AND
.B "*DON'T*"
EXPECT IT TO PROVIDE ANY SECURITY WHATSOEVER.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "lsh_keygen [-o " style "] [-l " nist-level "] [-a " algorithm "]"
.BI " [-q] [-d] [-v]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
lsh_keygen generates a public, private key pair
in
.BR SPKI (5)
format on stdout.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-o style"
Use
.I style
SPKI format.
Valid values of 
.I style
are
.BR transport , " canonical" , " advanced" " and" " international" .
The default style is
.BR transport .
See
.BR SPKI (5).
.IP "-l nist-level"
Determines the key length of the generated keys. The allowed range is 0\-8;
0 corresponds to a 512 bit key; 8 to a 1024 bit key. The default is 4, which
corresponds to a 768 bit keys.
.IP "-a algorithm"
Selects the algorithm to use. Currently the only valid value is
.B dsa
which selects the Digital Signature Algorithm
.BR DSA (5).
.IP -q
Quiet operation. Currently has no effect.
.IP -d
Debug operation. Currently has no effect.
.IP -v
Verbose operation. Currently has no effect.
.SH EXAMPLE
A typical usage of lsh_keygen is:

lsh_keygen -l 8 | lsh_writekey

Which generates a public, private key pair and stores it using
.BR lsh_writekey (1).
.SH BUGS
lsh_writekey should use
.BR random (4)
rather than a less strong source of randomness like
.BR urandom (4)
where available.
