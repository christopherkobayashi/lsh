/* A gateway is a mechanism to delegate some channels to a separate
 * process. The main lsh process opens a unix domain socket, and other
 * processes can connect and read and write clear text ssh packets.
 * Packets written to the gateway socket are forwarded to the remote
 * server. And certain packets received from the remote server are
 * delegated and can be read from the gateway.
 *
 * Most packets are passed through, with only the channel numbers
 * translated. CHANNEL_CLOSE messages are an exception, since the
 * close handshake is associated with deallocation of channel
 * numbers, which are independent for the gateway connection and with
 * the shared connection to the remote ssh server.
 */

/* The gateway socket is named "TMP/x-lsh-USER/HOST%REMOTE-USER".
 *
 * The choice of the '%' separator in the socket name makes sure we
 * don't collide with any valid dns names, or with literal IPv4 or IPv6
 * addresses. And it should be really rare in usernames. */
