/* The transport layer, for both server (lshd) and client
   (lsh-transport), speaks the ssh protocol on one end (two fd:s), and
   clear-text ssh packets on the other end.
   
    --------+           +-----------+           +--------
            |  -------> | SSH       | --------> |
    Network |    SSH    | transport | Cleartext | Application
            |  <------- | protocol  | <-------- |
    --------+           +-----------+           +--------

   We use non-blocking mode for i/o, with essentially a single-packet
   read buffer for each fd. Write buffers are larger, to avoid
   deadlock in the conversation with the remote peer. To stop buffers
   from filling up, whenever the write-buffer for the encrypted
   channel is getting full, we stop reading from the unencrypted
   channel, and vice versa.

   The write buffer for encrypted packets can also fill up with
   transport-layer packets generated in response to received encrypted
   packets. E.g, when receiving a KEXINIT message we need to reply to
   it directly; it is not passed to the application. We reserve buffer
   space of SSH_MAX_TRANSPORT_RESPONSE for such responses, and stop
   reading unencrypted data when less space than this is available in
   the buffer. If the buffer is filled up completely in spite of this
   margin, we disconnect.
