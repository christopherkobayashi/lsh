/* The transport layer, for both server (lshd) and client
   (lsh-transport), speaks the ssh protocol on one end (two fd:s), and
   clear-text ssh packets on the other end.
   
    --------+           +-----------+           +--------
            |  -------> | SSH       | --------> |
    Network |    SSH    | transport | Cleartext | Application
            |  <------- | protocol  | <-------- |
    --------+           +-----------+           +--------

   We use non-blocking mode for i/o, with essentially a single-packet
   read buffer for each fd. Write buffers must be larger, to avoid
   deadlock in the conversation with the remote peer. To stop buffers
   from filling up, whenever the write-buffer for the encrypted
   channel is non-empty, we stop reading from the unencrypted channel,
   and vice versa.

   If either write buffer fills up completely, the connection is
   closed. This can happen if the application or the remote peer
   requests a lot of data, but doesn't read any.
