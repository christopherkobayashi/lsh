Consider return values from handlers. A return value has seveal
components:

 x Success/failure indication
 
 x Next action (continue, close immediately, flush buffers then close,
   exit...)
 
 x Process return value in case the proper action is to exit.

It should be possible to encode all this information into a simple integer.
