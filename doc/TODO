ERROR HANDLING

Consider return values from handlers. A return value has several
components:

 x Success/failure indication
 
 x Next action (continue, close immediately, flush buffers then close,
   exit...)
 
 x Process return value in case the proper action is to exit.

It should be possible to encode all this information into a simple integer.


KEYS

Code is needed to generate, store and read dss keys. Preferably in a
SPKI/s-expression form.

USERS

Functions to lookup users, their passwords and .lsh/authorized_keys.

CHARSETS

Usernames and passwords must be translated from the systems charset
(default iso-8859-1) to UTF8.

CONFIGURATION

Read configuration files. Better command line options.
