/* FIXME: For now, use only password authentication. A better method
 * would be to first send a set of publickey authentication requests
 * for the available keys (for some configurable value of
 * "available"). This is analogous to unlocking a door by first
 * examining the keys on one's keyring to see if any of them can be
 * inserted into the lock. Preferably, at this point one should use
 * spki hashed public keys rather than the public keys themselves.
 *
 * Next we wait for SSH_MSH_USERAUTH_FAILURE or SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_PK_OK
 * messages. If any of the keys is recognized, we compute a signature
 * and send it to the server (analogously to inserting the key into
 * the lock and turning it around).
 *
 * If none of the keys were recognized, or if no keys were available
 * from the start, we ask the user for a password and attempts to log
 * in using that. */
