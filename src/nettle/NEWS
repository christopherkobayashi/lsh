NEWS for the 1.5 release

	Added RSA support. Key generation and signatures.
	
	Added support for HMAC (RFC-2104).

	Changed the interface for hash functions. The md5_digest
	function is now equivalent to the old sequence of md5_final,
	md5_digest, md5_init, and similarly for the other hashing
	algorithms. This makes the interface simpler.

	Fixed twofish bug spotted by Jean-Pierre Stierlin.

	Added des3 and cbc.
	
	New RFC-1321-like interface in nettle/md5-compat.h, suggested
	by Assar Westerlund.

	New libdes-style compatibility interface in nettle/des-compat.h.
