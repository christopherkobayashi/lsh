LSH - a free implementetion of the Secure Shell protocols.


LSH IS WORK IN PROGRESS. DON'T EXPECT THE CURRENT VERSION TO WORK, AND
*DON'T* EXPECT IT TO PROVIDE ANY SECURITY WHATSOEVER.

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation. See the file COPYING for details.

If you have downloaded a snapshot, you should be able to compile it
with

   ./configure
   make

If you have checked out lsh from cvs, things are more complicated. You
need at least autoconf, automake, GNU-make, gcc, make, gperf and scsh
to get going. The Makefile.am file is created by running ./make_am. If
the compiler complains that it can't find a file foo.h.x,
try creating it with make foo.h.x or ./make_class <foo.h >foo.h.x, and
similarly for missing foo.c.x files.

For an introduction to the workings of LSH, see the file HACKING.

Several people have contributed to LSH, see the AUTHORS file for
details.
