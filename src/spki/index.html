<h1>libspki</h1>
<h2>A library implementing the Simple Public Key Infrastructure</h2>

libspki a library for operations on SPKI certificates, ACL:s, and
access and authorization decisions. The library is work in progress,
it's not terribly useful yet. Some of the design:

<ul>
<li> Keep things simple. Do one thing, well.

<li> Start with the most crucial parts, certificates with only
     "principal" subjects. Names and thresholds are secondary.

<li> Make it a nice friendly C library, without global state, with
     configurable memory allocation, etc.
</ul>

<h1>About SPKI</h1>

SPKI is a way to think about certificates that makes a lot more sense
then the popular X.500 and X.509 standards. The emphasis is on
authorization, delegation and capabilities, rather than on names. See
<a href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2693.txt">RFC 2693</a> and <a
href="http://world.std.com/~cme/html/spki.html#1-SPKI/SDSI"Carl
Ellison's SPKI page</a> for more informaton.

<h1>Related projects</h1>

There are two other SPKI implementations I'm aware of: Intel's <a
href="http://www.intel.com/ial/security/">CDSA</a>, which is a pretty
big and does a lot more than just SPKI, and <a
href="http://www.pmg.lcs.mit.edu/~ajmani/sdsi/">JSDSI</a>, a Java
library by Sameer Ajmani.

<p>

The first application that will use libspki is <a
href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~nisse/lsh">LSH</a>, my ssh-2
implementation. I've planned adding real spki support for years, as a
good way both for delegating restricted access, and for certifying
hostkeys (which is usually the weakest link in all use of ssh).

<p>

libspki uses <a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~nisse/nettle">the
Nettle cryptographic library</a> for the few cryptographic operations
that are needed. Nettle, in turn, uses <a
href="http://www.swox.se/gmp">GMP</a>, the GNU bignum library, for
calculations.

<h1>Source code</h1>

The CVS repository is located at <a
href="http://cvs.lysator.liu.se/viewcvs/viewcvs.cgi/lsh/src/spki/?cvsroot=lsh">cvs.lysator.liu.se</a>.
Beware that the build system is not perfect, in particular it expects
to find Nettle as "../nettle" from both source and build trees, the
same way things are arranged if you check out all the complete lsh
source code.
