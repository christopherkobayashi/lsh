/* Allocation */

/* The memory allocation model (for strings) is as follows:
 *
 * Packets are allocated when the are needed. A packet may be passed
 * through a chain of processing functions, until it is finally
 * discarded or transmitted, at which time it is deallocated.
 * Processing functions may deallocate their input packets and
 * allocate fresh packets to pass on; therefore, any data from a
 * packet that is needed later must be copied into some other storage.
 *
 * At any time, each packet is own by a a particular processing
 * function. Pointers into a packet are valid only while you own it.
